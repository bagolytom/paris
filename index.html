      <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
          <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>
      <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
          <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <strong>Montmartre</strong> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <strong>la Seine</strong>.</p>

      <h4 id="day2">Day 2</h4>
          <p>On our second day, we went shopping on Avenue des Champs Elysees. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.</br></br>
After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to Notre Dame. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer.</br> After we finished shopping, we visited le Louvre.</p>

      <h4 id="day3">Day 3</h4>
          <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <strong>Arc de Triomphe</strong>. It's huge! We also went to <strong>le Musee D'Orsay</strong>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking.</br> I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
